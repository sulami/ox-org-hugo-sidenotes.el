* Introduction

This package is scratching a very particular itch of mine, so YMMV.

It provides org-mode->org-mode export with slight modifications to
allow for using a theme with [[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/][Tufte]]-style sidenotes.

The advantage gained from this is not having to litter non-org syntax
in your org-mode source files.

* Configuration

TBD
